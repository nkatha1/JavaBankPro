Bank Management System


Overview
The Bank Management System is a Java-based console application that simulates essential banking operations such as user registration, login, account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transaction tracking, and password management. It uses JSON for data persistence and leverages the Gson library for seamless serialization and deserialization.

This project is ideal for learning Java object-oriented programming, file handling, and implementing basic banking logic. It also serves as a strong portfolio piece demonstrating backend logic, user management, and data storage techniques.

Features
User Registration & Authentication
Secure registration and login system with password hashing for basic security.

Account Management
Users can create multiple bank accounts.

Transactions
Support for deposits, withdrawals, and viewing transaction history.

Password Management
Includes options for password reset and change password functionality.

Persistent Storage
User data and accounts are saved to JSON files to maintain state between sessions.

Console-based UI
Intuitive menu-driven interface for ease of use.

Technologies Used
Java 17+

Gson Library for JSON handling

File I/O for data persistence

OOP concepts (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
